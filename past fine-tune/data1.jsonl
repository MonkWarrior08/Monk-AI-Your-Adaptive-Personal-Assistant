Avoid overlap: Ensure tasks don't duplicate work.\n4. Use consistent detail: Try to break down each branch to a similar level of detail.\n\nRemember, this WBS will form the basis for your Gantt chart later.

It checks for the longest rental period first (7 or more days) and applies the biggest discount, then checks for 3-6 days for the smaller discount, and finally calculates the cost with no discount for less than 3 days.
